# Whether to expose and allow binding to a privileged TCP port for Node-RED TCP server flows.
# Notes:
# - Port 69 is a privileged port (<1024). Binding may require extra Linux capabilities.
# - If you run Node-RED with host networking, no Docker port mapping is needed, but the process
#   still needs permission to bind the port and your host firewall must allow it.
